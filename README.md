Football League Statistics
A newspaper from your hometown needs someone to create an archive of statistics from your local backyard soccer league. Since you are very close to the players and fans, you decided to create a program that provides these statistics at every moment of the season and in all subsequent seasons.

As the whole history database is being built in parallel by someone else and you don't want to wait, you got the idea to create a simulation of the season that generates data that you don't yet have, for testing your program.
